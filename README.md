## Lab: Todo App

In this lab, you're going put together all you've learned about listening
to DOM events and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to build a dynamic
Todo List application.

Tasks:
1. Write the HTML page
2. Add IDs and JS so that clicking the Add button adds the item in the
   "New item" text field to the todo list
3. Use event delegation so that clicking the 'x' buttons removes the item
